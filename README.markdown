**NOTE: On FreeBSD and OpenBSD `make` is not the GNU Make, so `gmake` should be used instead.**

You can download all source code using gnu make download target:

```sh
make download
```

## Installation

```sh
gem install image_optim image_optim_pack
```

Or add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'image_optim'
gem 'image_optim_pack'
```

## Development

Mac OS X binaries and libraries are built on host, others using [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

Boxes for vagrant are built using [veewee](https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee), check [boxes/Rakefile](boxes/Rakefile) and [boxes/definitions](boxes/definitions).

```sh
script/run # Build and test all for all oses and architectures
script/run NO_HALT=1 # Don't halt VMs after building
script/run NO_UP=1 # Don't start VMs before building (will fail if not already running)
script/run darwin 64 # Build only platforms matching darwin or 64

make # Build all tools and copy them to vendor/OS-ARCH for current OS and ARCH, then test
make all # same

make livecheck # Check versions
make update-versions # Update versions in Makefile

make download # Download archives
make download-tidy-up # Remove old archives
make build # Build all without copying to output directory

make test # Test bins for current os/arch
make test -i # Continue if one of bins fail

make clean # Remove build and output directories for current os/arch
make clean-all # Remove build root and output root directories
make clobber # `clean-all` and remove download directory
```
