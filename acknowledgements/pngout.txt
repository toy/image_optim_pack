PNGOUT / KZIP license:

I have gotten a lot of requests about bundling the command line executables, or releasing the source code to KZIP and PNGOUT. This is my license (updated 01/16/2021):

* The command line versions of PNGOUT.EXE and KZIP.EXE are free for use, as are the Mac and Linux ports.
* You may use PNGOUT- or KZIP-compressed content for non-commercial or commercial purposes.
* Redistributing, repackaging, or reusing the PNGOUT or KZIP executable is permitted for non-commercial projects that are distributed freely.
* For commercial requests (such as bundling with a commercial product), please write to my business partner, David Blake.
* When bundling, my credit (both my name and website) must be clearly displayed in some reasonable fashion that can be seen by an average user.
